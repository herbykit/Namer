# Namer
This is a project that I started in order to be able to take a list of names (and another descriptor for them, such as popularity or meaning) and gradually sort through them to choose which ones I liked most.

Compiled jar is available here:
[NameAnalyser](../NameAnalyser/lib/NameAnalyser.jar)

## How to use
In order to use this project, you will need to download the jar and install at least the Java 8 SDK to be able to run it. You may have to fix your ["PATH" variable](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/research/csrcbc/teaching/howto/javapath/) under system settings. The command to run is 
`java -jar [java file location and name] [name file location and name]`
